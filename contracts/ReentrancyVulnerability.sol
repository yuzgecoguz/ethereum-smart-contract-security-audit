/**
 * @title ReentrancyVulnerability
 * @author Oguzhan Yuzgec
 * @notice Demonstrates the classic reentrancy vulnerability pattern
 * @dev The withdraw function sends ETH before updating the sender's balance,
 *      allowing a malicious contract to recursively call withdraw() and drain funds.
 *
 * Attack vector:
 *   1. Attacker deploys a contract with a receive()/fallback() that calls withdraw()
 *   2. Attacker deposits ETH into this contract
 *   3. Attacker calls withdraw() - ETH is sent, triggering fallback
 *   4. Fallback calls withdraw() again before balance is zeroed
 *   5. Repeat until contract is drained
 *
 * Mitigation:
 *   - Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern (update state BEFORE external call)
 *   - Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard (nonReentrant modifier)
 *   - Use pull-over-push payment pattern
